Code is written for using various machine learning algorithms as exercise or small projects.  
## Time Series Analysis
This project is an example of accessing data using APIs and then cleaning, checking for anomolies, merging data from various sources, preparing data for further analysis. It also involves going through the basic statistics that can inform, and give a feel about the data in hands. These processess are very crutial in any data analysis and machine laerning processs. After going through rigorous pre-processing, we applied some available time series analysis techniques to predict future values.
